* ban, kick und tempban commands. warn/strike commands
* One module and db collection for all guild-specific configurations
* Make basic custom commands work
* New Approach at Localization
* Custom Commands dashboard disabled channels AND whitelisted channels (maybe by a switch, or two panels side by side)

## 2019

* Cache more Database stuff that's possibly impacting performance or makes too many calls that could impact performance 
* XP System (global and locale seperated, but connected somehow)
* Purchasable roles
* Marketplace (incl. purchasable roles)
* CC fix Logical Expression logic
