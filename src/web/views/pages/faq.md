## Why am I not being retweeted?

To be retweeted by AltBronyRT multiple factors come to play. Your tweet will be filtered by:

* containing sensitive content
* how similar it is to other tweets that have been sent around that time (spam filter)
* how often you've tweeted in the last hour (additional spam filter)
* specific terms in @Username and tweet
* how long your account has existed
* some secret formular

These points will add up to a relevance score, which if exeeding a specific value, lead to a retweet.

## I don't want the bot to retweet me anymore! Can I make it ignore me?

Yes, you can make the bot ignore you. Just @ it as follows: "**@AltBronyRT !ignore**". This will not only make it ignore you, but it will also stop recording your public brony activity.

To get unignored again simply send: "**@AltBronyRT !notice**"
